v0.1, Jun 3, 2013: Sketching out thoughts for a quick version

Drafting effort [X]

Overview
--------
Ultimately, I'd like to implement what's specified for
link:https://github.com/rjose/product-specs/blob/67d533/qplan.txt[qplan], but
I need to have something happen much quicker than that. I'll some basic
functionality in place first. We'll do everything in Lua. Data will be stored
in text files in something that would be easily parsed by awk.

Problem
-------
Here the scenarios we need to handle:

- Read skills from file
- Read team data from file
- Verify team data is valid wrt skills file (offline)
- Read/write work item data
- Read/write plan info (priority, cutline, is feasible, excess/short)
- Add work item (at position, above cutline, below cutline, bottom)
- Rank work item
- Estimate work item (array of skill/effort)
- Set cutline
- Check feasibility
- Write to format pastable into spreadsheet
- Read from spreadsheet (or spreadsheet export)


Architecture
------------
Will run from an interactive lua script. All functionality will be in Lua.
We'll organize the interfaces with the expectation that we'll re-code much of
this in C.

Prototypes
----------
- Create files and read them from Lua [][][]
- Write functions for reporting work items, current plan, team stats [][][][]
- Write functions for adding/manipulating work items [][][][]
- Write functions for updating plan (ranking, cutline) [][][]
- Add stub for updating feasibility [][]
