QPlan

Overview
--------
I want to have a better way of doing quarterly planning. I want to have this
be a data source for other applications here. The goal is to have a set of
prioritized items above a cutline that's reasonable to complete over a
quarter.

Problem
-------
Current quarterly planning is very time intensive and manual. Data is added to
spreadsheets in an ad hoc way. Information (like effort/role estimates) must
be continuously parsed manually. Even enumerating our staff needs to be done
manually. We're doing back-of-the-envelope calculations when we should
leverage the power of a computer.

Basically, planning takes too long, is too much effort, involves too many
people, and is difficult to revise.

Data gets stuck in the spreadsheet.

.What do we need?
- List people on a team by role
- Generate stats on this list of people (e.g., how many iOS devs, how many
  apps, how many QA).
  - Stats may also be available manpower
- System can assign work based on role/time left
- Create a set of tasks
- Apply prioritization to set of tasks. This can be simply manually ranking,
  or it could be something more interesting (like value-based scheduling).
- Estimate work for a task (a set of roles and the number of man-weeks for
  each one)
- Compute manpower required for a set of tasks. This will be by role
- Define a set of tasks by applying a cutline
- Need policy for how cutline changes when reapplying priorities
- We need to add notes to tasks
- We need to add tags to tasks. Do we need a separate tagging system?
- Need to define tracks for each task. This could tie into tags mechanism.
- Need statistics on tracks
- Need reports on tracks. Who's assigned? Who's the lead? What's the backlog?
  What's above the cutline
- Need to assign people to tracks
- Need a signoff mechanism
- Need auth framework?
- Need to create JIRA tasks automatically. Need to keep JIRA tasks in sync
  with our tasks

Solution
--------


- Pull incomplete items from previous quarters


Architecture
------------


Risks
-----
- How do we do accounting for fullstack devs? We don't want to double-count
  people who have multiple skills.
- How is this persisted?
- What is the interface? Combo of web interface, command line, ncurses, app?
- How to interface with JIRA
